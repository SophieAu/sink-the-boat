COSC1186 Interactive 3D Graphics and Animation Assignment 1 - Solvejg Au s3579664

----------IMPORTANT NOTE:
This program was coded on a Windows machine. Therefore, the makefile will compile for Windows by default. To compile for Linnux, simply use the keyword 'linux'


----------Missing Functionality:
All functionality required for a DI or higher. Cannons do not shoot. Pressing the designated keys calls the "starter functions" but these functions are empty.


----------Known Bugs:
When two keys are pressed at the same time, only the key that was pressed last will be registered by the program. This can (/ should be possible to) be solved by saving the pressed keys into an array and then running the saved elements through the switch-case routine.


----------References:
Most of the was written by referencing the lecture and tutorial notes as well as the sample code provided by Mr. Leach, to be found at http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~gl/teaching/Interactive3D/index.xhtml
