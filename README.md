A simple 2-player 3D game. The goal: Destroy the other ship.

## Installation
Simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/SophieAu/sink-the-boat/releases) and download the most recent version. That's it. To start the game, simply execute the file.

## How to Play
The game starts as soon as you execute the file. Every player has 4 lives (can take four hits) and unlimited ammunition. Between cannon shots, there is a delay of ~3 seconds.

The controls are:

|Key | Function|
|----|---------|
|    |         |

## Questions, Bugs etc.
If you have any questions and/or found a bug: Great! Simply open up an issue and explain in as much detail as possible what the problem is. I will get back to you asap. Unfortunately I can't guarantee that I can fix Windows- or Mac-only bugs as I only run Linux and tbh can't be bothered to spin up VMs. I will do my best though!

## Development
Issues and Pull Requests are always welcome. To work on the game, simply fork the `develop` branch and submit your Pull Requests to it. If you're new to computer graphics, have a look at the [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/) and [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/spec3/spec3.html) docs.

## Credit
The game started as an assignment in my Computer Graphics Course ar RMIT in Australia. Therefore, some code and all of my knowledge is courtesy of Mr. Leach (I'm so sorry for being stupid!). You can see the assignment [here](http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~gl/teaching/Interactive3D/index.xhtml).
